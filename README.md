# Tic-Tac-Toe in Java

A simple **Tic-Tac-Toe** game implemented in Java. This game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid until one player wins.

## Features
- **Turn-based gameplay**: Players enter row and column numbers to place `X` or `O`.
- **Win detection**: Checks for row, column, or diagonal matches.
- **Basic input validation**: Ensures players cannot overwrite an occupied cell.

## How to Run
1. **Compile the Java file**:
   ```bash
   javac xo.java
   ```
2. **Run the program**:
   ```bash
   java xo
   ```
3. **Follow the prompts** to play the game.

## Future Improvements
- Implement a **draw condition** to detect when the board is full.
- Add an **AI opponent** for single-player mode.
- Improve **input handling** to prevent crashes from invalid inputs.

Enjoy playing Tic-Tac-Toe! ðŸš€
